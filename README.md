# Hoagland CMSC313

- AUTHORS: Aidan Hoagland
- PURPOSE OF SOFTWARE: create a matrix library in both C and C++ that can solve the matrix equation given for Homework 8 CMSC 313
- FILES: 
- HoaglandHW8C++.cpp: submission for the C++ file for homework 8
- HoaglandHW8C.c: submission for the C file for homework 8
- BUILD INSTRUCTIONS: none, just run the files with gcc
- TESTING METHODOLOGY: test using each of the equation, then see if the correct result is displayed
- ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: I did not implement transposing for the C program as I did not figure out how to use malloc to simulate a 2D vector in time
